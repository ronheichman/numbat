# numbat

Endpoint visibility into AI agent activity, with local detection, optional
pre-action blocking, and forensic reconstruction.

numbat observes supported desktop, CLI, IDE, and gateway agents through local
hooks and plugins, OTLP/HTTP logs, and on-disk session artifacts. Live and
at-rest activity is normalized into one event model and evaluated by the same
CEL rule engine. Detection runs locally. Records can use stdout, a local file,
a durable on-disk queue, or HTTP delivery.

The [coverage matrix](docs/agent-coverage.md#matrix) is authoritative for each
host and surface. Blocking is off by default and limited to supported
synchronous pre-action hooks; see the [enforcement guide](docs/enforcement.md).

## Features

- **Live monitoring** through hooks, plugins, and OTLP/HTTP log exporters.
- **Endpoint-local detection** with built-in CEL rules, multi-step sequence rules,
  and custom YAML rules.
- **Opt-in blocking** through supported pre-action hooks. Enforce mode is
  disabled by default and applies only to rules marked `enforce: true`; all
  shipped rules are monitor-only.
- **Forensic reconstruction** from supported on-disk session artifacts, without
  prior numbat instrumentation.
- **Versioned NDJSON records** for events, findings, enforcement decisions,
  indicators, and scan summaries. Events and findings retain source references;
  [JSON Schemas](docs/schema/v0.3.0/) define the wire format.
- **Read-only artifact scanning** with secret redaction. Normal record output
  never includes a complete raw transcript; adding raw evidence files to a case
  bundle is opt-in.
- **Inventory and investigation tools** for read-only agent discovery,
  per-session timelines, and portable case bundles with SHA-256 manifests.
- **Single-binary distribution** for macOS, Linux, and Windows, built without
  cgo.

## Quick start

### Install

[Download a release](https://github.com/perplexityai/numbat/releases) for macOS, Linux,
or Windows on amd64 or arm64. Each release includes SHA-256 checksums. You can
also install with Go 1.26.6 or newer:

```
go install github.com/perplexityai/numbat/cmd/numbat@latest
```

<details>
<summary>Build a static binary from a checkout</summary>

macOS or Linux:

```
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath -o numbat ./cmd/numbat
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:CGO_ENABLED = "0"
go build -trimpath -o numbat.exe ./cmd/numbat
```

</details>

### Inventory and scan

These read-only commands do not install hooks or change agent configuration:

```
numbat agents
# scan all discovered parser-backed agents
numbat scan
# or limit automatic discovery to Codex
numbat scan --agent codex
```

### Monitor and enforce

Install live monitoring for any agent with
[live-capture support](docs/agent-coverage.md#matrix); the commands below use
Codex as a concrete example. Hooks start in monitor-only mode. `--emit all`
writes events, findings, indicators, and applicable enforcement decisions to
`~/.numbat/records.ndjson`.

```
numbat hook install --agent codex --emit all
numbat hook status --agent codex
```

> **Hook trust:** Requirements vary by agent and scope. For the Codex user hook
> above, review and trust its current definition in `/hooks` (CLI) or
> Settings > Hooks (app), including after changes such as `--enforce`. Codex
> hooks installed with `--managed` are trusted by policy. `hook status` verifies
> configuration, not execution or delivery. See the
> [deployment guide](docs/deployment.md#hook-trust-and-activation) for other
> agents and scopes.

All shipped rules are monitor-only. To enforce a detection, copy its complete
[shipped YAML](rules/) into a controlled operator directory, keep the same id,
add `enforce: true`, and bump its version. Validate and install that effective
policy for a supported pre-action hook:

```
numbat rules check --rules-dir ./numbat-policy
numbat hook install --agent codex --emit all \
  --rules-dir ./numbat-policy --enforce
```

### Example output

<details>
<summary><strong>Hook event</strong> (OpenClaw cloud-metadata browser request)</summary>

A controlled OpenClaw `before_tool_call` callback passed through numbat's
generated plugin becomes a typed network event with its proposed destination
and execution context. It also matches the high-severity cloud-metadata rule.

<summary><strong>Sequence finding</strong> (Claude Code hook sequence)</summary>

A controlled replay of two contract-valid Claude Code pre-action callbacks in
one session—secret-file access, then a proposed upload—produced this finding.
The rule also runs during artifact scans; the finding does not prove either
action completed.

<summary><strong>Enforcement decision</strong> (Codex <code>authorized_keys</code> write)</summary>

With a same-id operator replacement of `persistence.ssh_authorized_keys`
marked `enforce: true` at version `1.3`, a Codex `create_file` pre-action
matched the rule and numbat selected the agent-specific deny response. See
[Decisions](docs/enforcement.md#decisions) for delivery and enforcement semantics.

See the [built-in rule catalog](docs/rule-catalog.md) for other
detected behaviors.

The [CLI reference](docs/cli.md#the-record-stream) defines the complete record
contract, flags, and sinks. For rollout patterns and output durability, see
[docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md).

## Command overview

- Inventory and investigation: `agents`, `scan`, and `timeline`
- Live capture: `hook install`, `hook status`, `hook uninstall`, and `collect`
- Record delivery: `ship`
- Rule development: `rules check`, `rules list`, and `rules test`
- Case bundles: `case build` and `case verify`

Run `numbat --help` for the complete command list or
`numbat help <command>` for flags. See the [CLI reference](docs/cli.md) for
record modes, sinks, and exit codes.

`scan`, `collect`, `hook EVENT`, `hook install`, and `rules check|list|test`
accept `--rules-dir DIR` (repeatable) to add operator rules or replace embedded
rules by id.
Use `--no-builtin-rules` for an operator-only catalog. Full flag and output
reference: [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md).

- [Deployment](docs/deployment.md): install scope, trust, fleet rollout, and
  output delivery.
- [Enforcement](docs/enforcement.md): blocking semantics and failure behavior.
- [Rules](docs/rules.md): custom rule format, CEL fields, tests, and sequences.

## Scope

The [coverage matrix](docs/agent-coverage.md) documents support and known gaps
per agent, including deferred stores, fidelity limits, and root overrides.
Native Windows uses vendor-defined profile and AppData paths; WSL uses a
separate Linux home. numbat never executes agents or commands found in
artifacts, and it makes outbound requests only to configured HTTP sinks.

At-rest reconstruction is not disk or memory acquisition and cannot recover
activity an agent did not persist. Findings are rule matches, not proof of
compromise. Case-bundle manifests establish internal consistency; unsigned
bundles do not prove source authenticity or completeness.

## Security

Records can retain sensitive endpoint and agent context after redaction. See
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the threat model and private vulnerability
reporting.
